Feature: BioRuby.org main page IRC section

  The BioRuby project main page is the entry page for new comers to the
  project. Visitors should be able to see the current IRC log on the main page,
  and have access to older IRC logs. This may mean that we maintain an IRC
  robot on the server, similarly to what irc.bioruby.org now does (that robot,
  however, is rather fragile).

  In time we may even allow people to post messages on IRC through our website,
  using some Javascript client, though one could argue that it would be better
  to have a user set up an IRC client independently.
